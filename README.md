# EatInBerg: find friends in Annenberg
*Do you ever want to know who is in Berg? It may be easy to send the "Dinner at 6?" text to a close friend, but it's harder if you want to get close with someone you don't know that well. Now, you can always know who is in Berg so that you decide if you want to go! In addition, for those less social days, "ghost mode" allows you to remove your location from the site*
